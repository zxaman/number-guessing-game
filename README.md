# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Java. The game generates a random number within a given range and prompts the user to guess the number. The user continues guessing until they guess the correct number.

## How to Play

1. The system generates a random number between a specified minimum and maximum range.
2. The user is prompted to enter their guess.
3. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
4. The user continues guessing until they guess the correct number.
5. The game ends and displays the score based on the number of attempts made.

## Features

- Random number generation within a specified range.
- User input using the `Scanner` class.
- Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- Calculation of the score based on the number of attempts.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java file using the command: `javac NumberGuessingGame.java`
3. Run the compiled Java file using the command: `java NumberGuessingGame`

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following variables in the code:

- `minRange`: The minimum value of the range for the random number generation.
- `maxRange`: The maximum value of the range for the random number generation.

Feel free to modify the code to add more features, such as limiting the number of attempts, adding more rounds, displaying the score, or giving points based on the number of attempts.
